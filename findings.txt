Summarise your findings here (see specification).

By testing mystery1.dat, mystery2.dat and mystery3.dat, we can determine that there is a 
solution for 1 and 3, and no solution for 2. 

The specification states among the 3 mystery files, there is a "hard", "extremely hard" and 
"impossible" board. By ouputting the number of recursions, we can see how many attempts were 
made by the recursive backtracking in order to find the solution. For this, we also use the 
solve_board_tester function. These findings are summarized:
    mystery1.dat has 421488 recursions (and is solvable)
    mystery2.dat has 11533 recursions (and is NOT solvable)
    mystery3.dat has 14076 recursions (and is solvable)

Therefore, we can assign these as:
    mystery1.dat is "extremely hard"
    mystery2.dat has "impossible"
    mystery3.dat has "hard"

============================================================================================

By using a solve_board_tester function, which outputs the position we are testing each time 
as well as the total number of recursions attempted, we can determine exactly where each of 
the recursions in mystery2.dat is stopping and what we are checking. (To test this, just 
uncomment the //cout statement on line 223 of sudoku.cpp). We conclude that after 11533 
recursions, there is no solution found for this puzzle.
